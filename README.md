simple process killer

A process killer was urgently needed
"as not to distract"

just closes telegram.exe every 2 sec
if you need to close something else - just add processname in processList:   var processList = new[] { "Telegram","mspaint" };


oh, and ofk,  the process killer will have to be killed
